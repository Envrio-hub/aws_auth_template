# AWS Cognito Authendication

This is a template code to be used in apps that require
AWS authendication, using the *code* resposnse type and then
the grand type *authorization_code* to get a session token
that is stored as a cookie.

Run the ini_app.py to initiate the template app and then
your AWS user pool credentials to log in.

Be sure that you have saved the *cognito_credentials.json* file in the
main folder.
